Hello there, my name is Soufiane Baghdadi. I am a student at 1337 (42 networking school), where I am honing my skills in software development and networking. My journey in tech has equipped me with strong problem-solving abilities and a passion for innovation. I specialize in full-stack development, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies to build robust and scalable applications. My technical skill set includes proficiency in MySQL for database management, Laravel and Django for back-end development, and React.js for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Combining these skills with my growing expertise in networking, I am well-prepared to tackle complex challenges and contribute to impactful projects.
